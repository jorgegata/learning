# Introduction to Communication Protocols

A communicaiton protocol is a set of rules and conventions that facilitates the communication of two interconnected systems through a network or a comunication channel.

There are various ways first in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), which is a conceptual framework of sever layers that serves a specific layer. The protocols that are implemented at each layer correspond to each layer's function

1. Physical - transmission medium (e.g. fiber optics, wifi)
2. Datalink - data addressing (e.g. etherner, ARP)
3. Network - logical addressing (e.g. IP, ICMP)
4. Transport - reliable delivery (e.g. TCP, UDP)
5. Session - manage data transfer session (e.g. NetBIOS, PPTP)
6. Presentation - data encoding & encription (e.g. SSL/TLS)
7. Application - interface for user / software (e.g. HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP)

Again, each layer serves a purpose and each protocol is linked to serve that specific purpose.
