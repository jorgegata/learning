# Communication protocols

> A protocol is a set of structure, rules, and conventions.

In software engineering, we have a diversity of communication protocols that establish those rules, and some principles (e.g., REST) that builds in top of the protocols. We used the communication protocols to transmit information over a network or communication channel.

The importance is to produce and standardize interface and way of communication between systems, therefore facilitating the development, documentation, and usage of interconnected systems.

## Goal

The goal of the repository is to learn, understand why those are important, and carry on an implementation of various protocols in spinned up webservers in our local machine.
