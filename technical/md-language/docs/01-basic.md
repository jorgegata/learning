# Basic markdown

> Process of markdown: md -> md app -> HTML -> rendered output

Markdown is constituted by basic and advanced syntax. There are 'flaws' of markdown, as `commonmark` used by VSCode, or `djot` which derives most of the features from `commonmark` and fixes a few things that make its **syntax complex and difficult to parse efficiently**

The basics are the foundational blocks to annotate text (structure, formatting, presentation).

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| * / _ | italic | *example* / _example_ |
| ** / __| bold | **example** / __example__ |
| > | quotation | > this is a text |
| # | header (scale with number of #) | # HEADER 1
| 1. | numbered list | 1. One item |
| * / - / + | unnumbered list | + this is an item |
| `` | code snippet | explain a part of the code |
| --- | horizontal separation | hello --- this is a scond line |
| []() / ![]() | reference to a link, internal reference to an image | [google](https://google.com) |
