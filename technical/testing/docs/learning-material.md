## Phase 1: Recoignaisse

### Chapters and subchapters

1. Introduction to testing: definition, importance, conditions (artificial vs real), types, level, coverage.

### Vocabulary

* Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Planning, Requirement analysis (functional, non-functional), Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
* Manual testing: check one by one the functionality of each function/feature
* Automation testing: writing of scripts using suitable software or automation tools to test the software.
* White box (for structure): sees the code and write test cases that verify the correctness at code level
* Black box (structure): does not care about the code, but validates the functionality of specifications/requirements
* Functional testing
* Non-functional testing
* Unit test
* Integration test
* System test
* Performance test
* Usabilty test
* Compatibility test
* Levels of testing
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Fundamental concepts

* Software verification: check if we buld the product the right way (is doing what it is supossed to do?)
* Software validation (are we building the right product on user needs and requirements)
* Dimensions of testing (automation, knowing code, functional/non-functional, static/dynamic testing)
* Order/granularity of functional testing
* Code coverage
* Domain testing: selection of a few set of test vs potentially infinite test available.
* Test specialization (functions, data-based, databases...)
* Shift-left testing and shift-right (production, monitoring & validation) testing

## Phase 2: Goal Crystallization

Let's create a service (RESTful) API that allows for a single route a call from a different process of my machine (macOS) and transmit a response with a single parameter.

The goals of the learning:

* Design a RESTful API using Flask
* Call the API from the terminal using maybe curl (curl parameters learning) with a parameter. Understand the HTTP protocol and structure
* Create tests (Python) to understand if the functionality is correct or not.
* Create automatic docs (Swagger maybe?)
* Create automatic changelog maybe for docs as well?

## Phase 3: Structure creation (network creation maybe??)

How can we create an automatic plot with nodes and edges using Python to represent the knowledge we are creating here?


## Phase 4: Material curating

Let's select the material based on the nodes of point 4, based on our learning, foundational concepts, and having a variety of sources, diagrams... to understand the concepts.
