# Encryption of values

Add security to specific value, with different ways of making it:

* hashing: one-way mathematical, deterministic. Add salt to make **rainbow tables** useless.
* tokenization: key vault (to be secured) with tokens that yields to values
* encryption - generated key, cypher framework based on key and encription/decription available
