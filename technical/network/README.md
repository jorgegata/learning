# Network (Connectivity)

Repository associated to pure fundaments of networking, also having their protocols associated (not protocols to speak between processes in a OS).

# Phase 1: Recoignasse (structure)

1. Introduction
2. OSI model
3. Network Layer (IPv4, IPv6, WireGuard... and routing, network architectures, "packet lifecycle")
4. Transport Layer (TCP and UDP protocols)
5. Firewalls, proxies, DNS...
6. Linux Networking Toolkit (2026)

## Phase 2: Goal

As a Software Engineer and Systems Engineer, I want to know in a pragmatic sense the network fundamentals to achieve professional profficiency. I need to cover first a well structure based on modern architectures and concepts in 2026. The Operating System (OS) i am using is unix-based (specifically linux)

## Phase 3: Filling-up documents and article (information curating)

## Phase 4: Schemating information

## Phase 5: Drilling and projects

## Phase 6: Rethinking the plan
