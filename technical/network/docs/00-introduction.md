# Network

> The network & connectivity is a fundamental characteristic (non-functional usually) of a good design system. It is related to other characteristics such as **security**

A System Engineer is involved in the architecture and design of the whole system. Here, there is a profound knowledge on how to **structure** and **define** things.

A hacker usually understands systems and design in order to isolate, test them, and achieving end goals towards tweaking those systems.

> The network is kind of "plumbing": it is a programmable, observable, and encrypted layer.

## Network in 2026

In the past, usually the implementations were monolithic and now, it is distributed and ephemeral container networking (Kubernetes/cloud-native) that defines professional profficiency.

You deal with **virtual overlays** and **software-designed networking (SDN)**

- Moved from "packet swtiching" to "application-aware networking"
- Latency is the new downtime, and security is Zero Trust (identity-based, not IP-based)
