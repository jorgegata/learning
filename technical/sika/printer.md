This file contains the workflow to setup the printer in the building 1A, 4th floor, on the following printer:

- Printer name: CH30735
- Network route: \\CHPRINTER\CH30735 *(\\server_name\printer_name)*

Every floor has a device to scann and print. All queue work is usually done through the [UniFlow App](https://sikauniflow.eu.uniflowonline.com/Login?ReturnUrl=%2F&#OAuthRequest/OneDriveForBusiness).
