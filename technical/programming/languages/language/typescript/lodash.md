# Lodash Library

Lodash is an utility library that provides a wide range of helpful functions to make working with arrays, objects, strings, and other data types more **convenient** and **efficient**

## Why would you choose Lodash instead of Built-in functions?

Some function programming like ``.map()`` or `.filter()` to work with objects, string, arrays, or any other data structure... is now feasible.

However, there are still some use cases where lodash is still useful:

1. **Deep Operations** - like deepclone, where you need to clone nested objects, or no deep equals
2. **Complex data manipulation** - get nested property, set nested property...
3. **Peformance critical operations:** like lodash's debounce.
4. **Functional programming helpers** for chaining methods
