# Languages overall

This repository is to have a general grasp of what is trully necessary from a language point of view to be fully proficient in a programming language to allow for tasks like:

- Scripting
- Rolling up servers
- Data transfer through various protocols
- Database communications
- Bit-based programming (hardware drivers and communications, flags...)

## To-Do to become profficient

These are the tasks to become such a legend in python profficiency, from most vanilla to third-party tools and library concepts

1. Best idiomatic practices
2. Use of functools, itertools, operators, collections
3. Typing Concepts (Generic in classes)
4. Built-in functionality tell.
5. Built-in functionality on standard primary types and structures (list, dict, tuple, set)
6. Built-in packages (`os`, `math`, `pprint`, `textwrap`, `csv`, `sqlite3`, `argparse`, `subprocess`, `re`, `datetime`, `sys`, `logging`, `copy`, `urrllib`, `http.server`)...
7. Third-party packages (comeback on `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`...)
