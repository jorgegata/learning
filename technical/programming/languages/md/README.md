# Syntax md

> Easy markup language for human and machines, device agnostic (display consistently), without the use of HTML tags or text editor.

md is a human-readable syntax (lightweight markup language) designed to be easy for reading and writing both for humans and for computers (transformation to HTML), **using simple punctuation characters (e.g., *, **, -, 1., ``...).

> The original syntax in markdown contains some complexity. Some of this complexity and parsing difficulties are addressed by **commonmark** (used by VSCode, keeps the device-agnostic develop and rendering), but some further complexity is addressed by **djot**.

Furthermore, there are tools that does not only allow to describe and make it easy readable/writable formats for several use cases, but transform this representation from one thing to others.

**Pandoc** is an universal open-source document converter that can transform files from one markup format to another. It supports a wide ranges of input formats and output formats. (Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, DocBook, EPUB, ODT, Word docx...)
