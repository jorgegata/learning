# Bash fundamentals

> `bash` means 'Bourne Again Shell'.

``bash`` is a interactive command interpreter and scripting language used to interact with the OS and do terminal-based tasks. Ideal for automation and cross-platform capabilities

`zsh` if sully customizable, having features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and support for plugins (ideal for modern workflows)

## Features of bash

1. **Brace expansion:** generate combinations or sequences based on a specified pattern or set of values (similar to comprehension lists) --> example: {1...5} or {1...5}{a,b}
2. **Tab completion:** if you write a command, bash autocompletes with tab for you...
3. **Portability:** you can invoke bash with the --posix option or stating set -o posix
4. **Command history:** using the `history` command you can check up to 500+ commands that you've run previously in the shell
5. **Batch and concurrency:** you can run commands one after another using `;` or `&`
