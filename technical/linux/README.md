# Unix-systems repository

The operating system concept is the underlying system that manages all resources of a machine, and allow a user to interact with the different software implemented.

As operating systems, there are two that excels in top of the rest: unix (macOS, GNU/linux) and windows based.

It is crucial to understand the most important processes, the concepts, and several important stuff that makes a developer useful
