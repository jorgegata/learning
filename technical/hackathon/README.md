# Sika Hackathon

A hackathon is an intense and time-bound competition where teams of developers, designersm and domain experts collaborate to create functioning software or hardware prototytes. It combines "hack" (creative problem-solving) and "marathon" (endurance).

In the case of Sika, we have teams composed of 1 Chemist (knowledge), 2 Data Scientist (create and connect building block, design and serve app), 1 data engineer (create and design building blocks, flow of data).

## Challenges

1. Expert knowledge is not digitalized
2. Domain knowledge is at unstructured, non-searchable format
3. Sika know-how is not universally available.

> Design a tool that digest unstructured data and provides **deterministic chemical knowledge**, **making it universally available**.

## Data provided

1. pdf files from SIP
2. Text with chemistry theory (german)
3. Text coming from transcripts from interviews (most important chemical relationships and hard constraints)
4. Set of hard chemical rules for guidance and filtering

## Tool provided

1. Databricks platform and Azure API LLMs access
2. Testing suite for correctness
3. Basic building blocks

## What is expected?

1. Data pipeline and transformation
2. Chatbot answering question
3. Presentation pitch

> Win the most accurate answers to expert chemical questions.
