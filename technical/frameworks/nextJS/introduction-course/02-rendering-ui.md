# Rendering UI

Pages are DoM. which are trees of different parts (html / document > body > div > h1/button/ul...).
It bridges the code and the UI, and you can use HTML methods and Javascript to manipulate the DoM by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting specific elements in the UI.

DOM manipulation aims to **target**, and **change** style and content.
