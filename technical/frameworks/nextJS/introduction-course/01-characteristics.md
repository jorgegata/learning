# Good Characteristics

The nextJS is a flexible react fraemwork that give you building block

## Building blocks of a web app

1. User interface: how data is consumed and interactivity
2. Routing: how do you navigate through the app
3. Data fetching and caching: where data lives and how you access is
4. Rendering: when and where you render static or dynamic content 

## More architectural
5. Integrations: how do you couple other services you use and how you connect to them
6. Infrastructure: when you deploy, store, and run your application code.
7. Performance: how to optimize application for end user
8. Scalability: how the application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grows
9. Developer Experience: team's experience building and maintaining the application

## React and NextJS

React just takes the User Interface part of the characteristics. The rest is up to other frameworks...
So it poses the building blocks of it. 

> If you build an application using only React, it will require time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for most common application requirements

NextJS handles the tooling and configuration needed for React and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
