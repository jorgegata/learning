# Advanced syntax

Whenever we want to continue with more advanced stuff (usually for more advanced technical users), we should master the advanced code snippets

## Table

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| Own table | draw of a table | like this table |
| ``` ``` | fenced code block with language | allows to put you a big code snippet within a certain programming language |
| footnotes | `[^1]` | It creates a footnote at the end of the md |
| custom header id | # and {#custom-id} | allows for directly link to headings and modify them with CSS. You can create *anchor links* with this technique |
| definition list (`djot`) | term\n: | you can see an example below |
| strikethrough | ~~Hello~~| to highlight that something was legacy maybe (used in the past, not anymore) |
| task list | - [x] | enumered with x and brackets to create the task list |
| highlight (`djot`) | `== to highlight ==` | this is an ==example== |
| subscript (`djot`) | ~2~ | wrap with ~ |
| superscript (`djot`) | ^2^ | wrap with ^ |

## Examples

this is to subscript H~2~O 

### Footnote

This is a sentence with a footnote [^1]

### Definition list

This is a equivalent to term: definition, as it seems to not work (idk why)
<dl>
    <dt> Term 1
    <dd> definition 1
    <dt> Term 2
    <dd> definition 2
</dl>

### Task list

- [x] this is a task list
- [ ] incompleted btw
