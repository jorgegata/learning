# Learning Framework

Traditionally, learning has been served in a guided way through certifications, courses, or institutions that verify your knowledge on a certain topic. Thus, the pre-learning work has always been taken from us, giving no responsibility on the student to reflect and guide himself towards what he desires to learn.

In this repository, a guide towards **pre-learning** is presented and prepare us for the learning process execution. The guides here can be framed into other methodologies as the **Ultralearning principles**.

This learning methodology is goal-oriented or project-oriented. This means discovering related concepts to carry on with that specific project or goal.

The knowledge expansion is better to be done through reading general topics book to provide you of an overview to estimulate creativity.
