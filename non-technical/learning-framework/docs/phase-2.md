# Phase 2: Goal crystallization

> Do not go into general terms like *how do I learn programming*, instead, change towards a goal oriented

Key questions are:

* What will I be able to do when I am done?
* What is my threshold competency -> work proficiency or mastery?
* Why do I actually want this -> motivation

We enforce **backward design**, where we target the final outcome and work backwards to what you need to learn.

An example of goal crystallization would be -> I will be able to build and deploy a neural network to solve a novel classification problem.
