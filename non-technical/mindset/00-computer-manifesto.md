# Computer manifesto

## Recall fundamentals

- 4 critical pillars

## 1. GENERAL TRUTHS

1. We are lucky to live in a world of computers that allows us to create beauty, peace, and love. We can express ourselves in terms of computing creativity
2. We are responsible to create beauty, peace, and love with computers

## 2. TELL MYSELF

1. IT IS ONLY A COMPUTER
2. It does not depend on our level of proficiency, we are good persons independently of the computer itself
3. We do not compare ourselves with the rest. If someone is doing beautiful computing, we observe the person and grateful us to live in a world next to marvelous fellows
4. There will be always someone with more computing skills and less computing skills

## 3. WHY DO COMPUTING

2. To increase our own spiritual growth and let us live more happy
3. To contribute and keep up the pace of all present and past people that has vastly contributed to the creation of systems and computing

## 4. AVOID REASONS

1. To become famous or rich
2. To manipulate people
3. To self-esteem
4. To be 'hip' (you do not need that to be aware of anything)
